##App center

By default, a new build is triggered every time a developer pushes to a configured branch. This is referred to as "Continuous Integration". If you prefer to trigger a new build manually, you can change this setting in the configuration panel. 



### Configuration

Detailed documentation with configuration for Android and iOS build: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/build/react-native/

### Distribute

Distributing with App Center is quick and easy, and does not require the App Center SDK to get started.

1. [Add collaborators to your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps) to collaborate and grant access to all releases.
2. [Create Distribution Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/groups) to organize your testers and manage access.
3. [Upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/uploading) a new application build and select the desired users and distribution groups for the release.
   - After you have distributed a new release, App Center sends an email to the chosen users notifying them that a new build is available for them to download.
   - Integrate the App Center SDK and enable [In-App Updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/inappupdates) to help your users stay always on the latest release.
4. [Install the release](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/installation) onto your device by clicking on the link in the email.

If you are distributing an iOS build, learn more about how handle the [collection of device UDIDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/auto-provisioning) for device provisioning or enable you to [automate the whole process with auto-provisioning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/auto-provisioning).
